Git has a lot of features that are useful for anyone working in code development, but if all you care about is trying to get the code on your computer onto the raspberry pis and vice versa here is the basic process:

For all code changes, you should be on branch "testing". This is necessary when you push or pull anything. To get on this branch type "git checkout testing".

[make changes]

git commit -am "[message here]"

git status

git push

[changes have been updated on the server]


To get all of the changes from the server since you last updated:

git pull


These commands can be used on the raspberry pis or your computer from a terminal with git bash. You can also do all of this from the "GitHub for Desktop" application and only use the command line on the pis.

-the git commit -am line is committing your local changes to the git stored on the local machine
-the git status should show that everything is up to date...IF THERE ARE STILL CHANGES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN COMMITTED YOU NEED TO TYPE "git add [filename]" FOR EACH FILE (or "git add *")
-git push sends your changes up to the remote server

-git pull gets the changes from the remote server

NOTE: you should make sure that you have the latest changes from the remote server ("git pull") before you try to push files
