# RoombaCI-Clemson
Creative Inquiry Project on Swarm Robotics with Arduino-controlled Roombas.

Welcome to the Roomba Creative Inquiry Project at Clemson University under the direction of Dr. Yongqiang Wang.
We will be using GitHub to organize and manage our Arduino code for the project.
GitHub allows us to incorporate necessary changes and updates from multiple users at the same time.
