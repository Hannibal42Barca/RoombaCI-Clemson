Robot Networks FoCI Abstract:
The goal of the Robot Networks Creative Inquiry to achieve a platoon of coordinated Roomba robots via decentralized control. The Roombas are controlled by a Raspberry Pi microcontroller programmed in Python. The Roombas form a decentralized network, where each Roomba operates independently of each other, and no robot directly commands any other robots. They are able to communicate with each other and send information wirelessly. Using the information collected from the other Roombas and from onboard inertial measurement sensors, each Roomba is able to navigate its way into position within the desired formation. The decentralized nature of the network allows for more robots to join the formation seamlessly. Students gain experience with wiring electrical circuits and sensors, and with programming microcontrollers to interface with the sensor data and achieve the desired robotic behavior.
